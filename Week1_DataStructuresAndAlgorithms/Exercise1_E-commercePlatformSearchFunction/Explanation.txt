Big O Notation:
Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithmâ€™s running time as the input size grows. It helps analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms, especially for large datasets.

	Best Case: The minimum time required (e.g., first element is the target).
	Average Case: The expected time over all possible inputs.
	Worst Case: The maximum time required (e.g., target not found or last element).

Linear Search:
Time Complexity: O(n) in worst and average case, O(1) in best case.
Binary Search:
Time Complexity: O(log n) in worst and average case, O(1) in best case.
Requires the array to be sorted.

For small or unsorted datasets, linear search is simple and effective.
For large, sorted datasets, binary search is much faster and more efficient.
